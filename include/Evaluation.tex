\chapter{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

The purpose of this chapter is to explain how the final iteration of the prototype was evaluated. The evaluation aims to present the findings of the target group test, and provide a better understanding of if and (if so) how, the physical prototype facilitates collaboration in groups.\\\\

The final test was conducted on the 4th grade class at Skt. Annæ elementary school which was also the class on which the workshop \autoref{sec:workshop} was conducted. The goal of the test was to gather both quantitative data as well as qualitative data. As so the test was divided into two tests. The qualitative test was an observational test, with focus on the collaboration (\autoref{sec:observationalTest}), when the participants - within groups - performed a given task with the tool (to be further explained in the following \autoref{setuptest}). The quantitative test was in the form of a Likert scale, concerning the former task given. These tests aim towards evaluating the prototype in correlation to the design requirements, as well as answering the final problem statement. 

\section{Methods}
This section will describe the methods used in correlation to the methods presented in \autoref{chap:methods}. It will present both the methods used to conduct the different tests, as well as which methods that has been used to analyze the data.

\subsection{Qualitative Test}
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:observationalTest}, the test was conducted with two non-participating observers that would take note of the observed collaboration in the groups. These would focus on the the apparent group roles that potentially emerged doing use. 


\subsection{Quantitative Test}
To test whether the test participants found the prototype collaborative or not, a Likert scale was used. The scale ranged from \textit{Strongly Disagree} to \textit{Strongly Agree}. The questions focused on statements which would give insight in how the test participant experienced the prototype in relation to collaboration with the other participants. For all the questions on the Likert scale see appendices \ref{fig:likertScale} and \ref{sec:testPaper}. The purpose of the Likert scale was for the participants to answer both positive as well as negatively driven statements about different parts of collaboration i.e. if they felt that a person had more control than the others, or if they felt that they took part in the activities on the prototype.\\\\

To evaluate and analyze the Likert scale data, different mathematical formulas are applied. To analyze the data, the mean will be calculated as well as the standard deviation to see how the responses turned out. To test the internal consistency of the test, the Cronbach Alpha formula will be applied (see \autoref{sec:cronbachAlpha}).

\section{The Test}
As mentioned, the final test was conducted on the 4th grade class on the Skt. Annæ elementary school. The total amount of participants were 25 students, divided into five subgroups. Each group consisting of five participants took part in the activities on the prototype and afterwards they would fill out the Likert scale paper. Each group had an approximate 10-13 minutes on the prototype, and then 3-5 minutes filling out the Likert scale.

\subsection{The Setup} \label{setuptest}
The test was split up into two parts. The first part was where the students were executing the test while being observed. When the participants were lead into the room, they were first of, given a short introduction of how the prototype functions (with explicit attention to the areas of problem found in the usability test \autoref{improvementsUsability}), and what the purpose of the prototype is. Afterwards, the participants were given the task to re-create the melody \textit{Mary Had a Little Lamb}, on the prototype. While playing the tune, the participants were being observed by two observers using the non-participant method\cite[p.~64-67]{bjoernerBog}. \\\\
When the participants completed the tasks, they were taken outside to complete a Likert scale about their collaboration using the prototype. 

\subsubsection*{Moderator}
The moderator introduced the test participants to the test \todo{what does this even mean ? } as well as introduced them to the tasks that they were to perform. Furthermore, the moderator would answer any general questions, or questions regarding the execution of the test \todo{de skal da ikke vide omkring testen i sig selv ?} or the tasks. The same person also had a leader role and made sure that the test was conducted according to plan, and made sure that the task did not exceed the time limit. This person would only introduce the prototype and the tasks, while staying out of the test as much as possible to avoid causing biased participants\cite{bjoernerBog}\todo{Find page number}.

\subsubsection*{Observers}
The observers would sit in the back of the room while not talking or interacting with the test participants in any way. They used the non-participant method which means that they are not allowed to take any participation in the test. When the test participant entered the room, they were each given a label with a letter and a number on, for the observers to keep track of the different participants. The labels were setup as GROUPNUMBER/LETTER, i.e. 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 2A, 2B, etc. The observers goal was to see if the test participants had patterns in a collaborative sense, while testing the prototype. They would observe factors such as group roles, if a natural leader would take place or everyone attempted to work together equally etc. Furthermore, the observers would strive to observe which type of collaboration, or indications of same, if any, would take place. 

\subsubsection*{Likert Scale moderators}
After the participants were finished interacting with the prototype, they would be led out of the room, where they would fill out a Likert scale form. The moderators would hand out the papers and introduce the questions. As the participants are children, the moderators made sure to thoroughly explain each question and answer the participants question if they had any. Furthermore, the moderators would make sure that they did not affect the participants by presenting both positive and negative answers equally.

\section{Results}
In this section, the results of the test will be presented, both the unprocessed results and the processed ones. As mentioned, both an observation and a Likert scale was conducted. 

\subsection{Likert Scale}
The Likert scale consisted of 8 questions with each question consisting of 5 values. These values have been plotted and measured and all the answers can be seen in the boxplot in \autoref{fig:boxploteval}. In the figure, the blue boxes represent the majority of the answers, the red lines represent the median, and the red dots represents the outliers which is in general disregarded. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{figure/Evaluation/collab.tex}
	\centering
	\caption{A boxplot showing all answers to each question}
	\label{fig:boxploteval}
\end{figure}

To get a better understanding of the reliability of the test and the Likert items, the results were calculated with different formulas. In \autoref{fig:stddev} the mean of each question as well as the standard deviation are calculated. The reason that these were calculated was to get insight in how big the difference in the responses were. As seen in the figure standard deviation
is approximately 1 for each question.

	\input{figure/Evaluation/meanStd.tex}
	\centering
	\caption{This figure displays the mean plotted in bars marked with blue, and the standard deviation as the error bars marked with red}
	\label{fig:stddev}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the mean and the standard deviation for each question can be seen in \autoref{table:questionsCalc}. This table also displays the measured Cronbach alpha of the Likert scale. The Cronbach alpha results in a total of 0.56, which is in general considered lower than acceptable, a rule of thumb is that 0,7 or above is the goal.\autoref{sec:cronbachAlpha}

\subsection{Observation Test}
For the observational part of the test, the two observers wrote down the activities of each group, how they collaborated and any miscellaneous things of interest. The condensed version of these notes can be seen in \autoref{table:observationalNotes}, while the full version of the notes can be found in appendix \autoref{table:observationalNotesBig}. 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Table showing the condensed version of the observational notes from the test}
\label{table:observationalNotes}
\input{figure/Evaluation/observationalNotes.tex}
\end{table}
As for collaboration, group 1 and group 5 mostly had a natural leader, while group 3 and group 4 had a more dynamic leadership, with either three or more \textit{"leaders"} guiding the group. During group 2, no natural group leader was observed to occur, and the group's collaboration was noted to be chaotic and disorganized.
