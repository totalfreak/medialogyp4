    \section{Reliability}
    
        Did we have a manuscript for the moderator of the test?
        Did we have a setup template to follow for the test?
        Same tasks, same order.
        
    \section{Validity}
        Musically gifted children, might make the music part of the prototype background, while they could focus on working together, could be different for \textit{"normal"} children.
        The teacher was directed to randomly assign children to groups, but since she was their teacher, she most likely inserted some passive bias into the selection process.
        Face validity seems good.
