    \section{Reliability}
        
        Did we have a manuscript for the moderator of the test?
        Did we have a setup template to follow for the test?
        Same tasks, same order.
        
    \section{Validity}
        Musically gifted children, might make the music part of the prototype background, while they could focus on working together, could be different for \textit{"normal"} children.
        The teacher was directed to randomly assign children to groups, but since she was their teacher, she most likely inserted some passive bias into the selection process.
        Face validity seems good.
        
        
        
        
        
- Number of test subjects
            
- Number of questions in the Likert Scale(<10)

- Improved likert scale. Better Cronbach alpha. "Testing the test"
        
- ? More iterations to improve usability(SUS score)

- Maybe we should have had footage/recordings for observation tests to eliminate observers interpretation/memory problems

- External validity: Usability test was conducted by convenience sampling university undergraduates, which fall into the category of being over used 70\% 90\%
